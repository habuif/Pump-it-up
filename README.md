# Pump-it-up
This is my attempt at the Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table contest. You can find the information about the contest here: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/leaderboard/?page=1 /n
The best result i got was 0.8161 (accuracy rate). At the moment, the highest accuracy rate is 0.8294 (recorded at 16/03/2023).
Feature engineering and hyperparameter-tuning could be improved in the future to achive better resutls.
